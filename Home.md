Would like to look to leverage Khoj to help create templates and reports that can be used for this project.

Also would like to find a way to generate a series of examples for each of the templates and workflows.

Want to be able to leverage AI to analyze a year end report (from template) and provide evidence as to where to place them on a continuum. Of course in order to do this I will need a base description of their role as well as the rules for continuum evaluation.

Looks like I may need to find a way to localize which files are being used when interacting with Khoj, as it has context of my other vault for EPSM as well.
