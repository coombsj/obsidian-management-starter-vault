## Communication Preferences

### 📈 How Do You Like to Receive Constructive Feedback?

*Immediately/ad hoc? Or should I save it up and tell you in our 1:1s? Do you prefer written in email? Slack? Or do you want to be able to discuss it over a call?*

>

### 🎉 How Do You Like to Receive Praise?

*"What things can I do that will meaningfully show you that you are appreciated and we want you here?” This might be public shout outs at an all hands (or that may be the absolute LAST thing you ever want). Maybe you will feel appreciated by getting gift cards or an afternoon off or by sending a regular trickle of capybara videos.*

>

### ☀️ What Are the Work Areas That Excite You Most?

*In the roles I’ve had, there is often a broad scope of work that individual contributors cover, so knowing who prefers to do what helps keep folks happy.*

>

### 🔥What Things Burn You Out?

*This might be “never put me in charge of documentation.” It might be “Please don’t tell me how to do something, just point me at the problem or I’ll feel stifled.” It might be “boredom.”*
